# Fake-Product-Identifier
In today's world where product duplication is a very common phenomenon, we have tried our bit to create a system which can up to some extent avoid the selling and usage of counterfeit products. Our portal is quite simple and easy to use - the sellers or manufacturers registering their products with us for the first time will have to verify their company by providing the CIN (CORPORATE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER) and all the other necessary information; once verified they can register their products and get a unique QR Code for each product. Each QR Code generated holds a Unique HASH VALUE, which makes it almost impossible to counterfeit them. The customer can easily scan the QR Code or can upload the image of QR Code on our web application and can verify the authenticity of the product!
